# WebScraping
My first web scraping. So  I extract the table from this site "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_traffic-related_death_rate" using python. After doing that I cleaned the data using the excel.

# Objectives:
To successfully extract a specified dataset from a target website using web scraping techniques in python.
To clean and organize the extracted data in Excel for further analysis.

# Challenges:
I will be honest, I am a beginner and I was taking time extracting the data since it was not in the list but it was in an array. Example my header was in this form: [[coloumn1],[coloumn2]] so I need to convert it to list.

# File Attached was my output
